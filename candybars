#For example, suppose that a candy company produces both milk chocolate and dark chocolate candy bars.
#The product mix is 50 percent of the candy bars are milk chocolate and 50 percent are dark chocolate.
#Say you choose ten candy bars at random, and choosing milk chocolate is defined as a success.
#The probability distribution of the number of successes during these ten trials with p = 0.5 is shown here.
